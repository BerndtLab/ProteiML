Overview of ProteiML_
===================

.. _ProteiML: http://www.berndtlab.com/

``ProteiML`` represents is a plug-and-play tool tailored for protein engineers seeking to optimize functional proteins. `ProteiML`'s power and utility resides in its human-out-of-loop decision-making capability. `ProteiML` learns from large mutation datasets and extracts mutational trends that often evade researchers capacity to percieve in large datasets. These insights, which researchers may find challenging to ascertain, are synthesized into a comprehensive list of suggested mutations. Furthermore, the platform accomplishes this feat within a remarkably short timeframe, delivering results in a matter of hoursâ€”a process that would otherwise demand days when employing traditional avenues like protein structure analysis and literature review.


Motivation
----------
Traditional engineering of functional proteins has relied on a trial-and-error mutagenesis approach that depends on researchers fundamental understanding of protein dynamics to achieve optimized proteins. This methodology is time, resource, and intellectually demanding. With ``ProteiML``, identifying advantageous mutations is streamlined, accelerating the pace of protein engineering and opening doors to a new era of functional protein design.
